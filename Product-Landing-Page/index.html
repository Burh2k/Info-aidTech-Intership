        Our Company

        Our Heritage
        Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It was here
        where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the
        world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the
        seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.

        Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and become captivated
        with Starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joining the company in 1982, a different cobblestone road would
        lead him to another discovery. It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s
        coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to
        Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and embarked on our next chapter as a
        coffeehouse.

        Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California, Washington, D.C. and New
        York. By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan, followed by Europe in 1998 and China
        in 1999. Over the next two decades, we would grow to welcome millions of customers each week and become a part
        of the fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all around the world. In everything we do, we are always
        dedicated to Our Mission: With every cup, with every conversation, with every community - we nurture the
        limitless possibilities of human connection.

        Coffee & Craft
        It takes many hands to craft the perfect cup of coffee – from the farmers who tend to the red-ripe coffee
        cherries, to the master roasters who coax the best from every bean, and to the barista who serves it with care.
        We are committed to the highest standards of quality and service, embracing our heritage while innovating to
        create new experiences to savor.
